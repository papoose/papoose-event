Papoose OSGi Event Admin Service
=====
<em>An OSGi Event Admin Service implementation.</em>

The Event Admin service provides a place for bundles to publish events, regardless of their destination. It is also used by Event Handlers to subscribe to specific types of events.

Events are published under a topic, together with a number of event properties.  Event Handlers can specify a filter to control the Events they receive on a very fine grained basis.
